# Project Description
* Do you need to rock yet don't know how to play guitar? A(I)R Guitar is a native iphone app that will allow you to make loud guitar chords without knowing anything about guitar. It will use the augmented reality features of the iphone to allow you to play air guitar. It will track your hand movements, and when your hand crosses the plane of your waist, chords will sound.

# Problem statement
* Many people need to rock and don't know how. They need a native iphone app that allows them to make air guitar motions and have loud power chords come out of the phone.

# How will your project solve this problem?
* A(I)R Guitar will use the augmented reality features of the iphone to track hand movements, and produce guitar chords.

# Map the user experience
* Jackie Rotten will open up the app on her iphone. She will give the app permission to use her camera to track her hand movements. She will put the iphone down in front of her, stand in front of the iphone, and move her hands to make guitar noises. When she is finished giving offerings to the Gods of Rock, she will close the app.

# What technologies do you plan to use?
* Swift, and the ARKit and CoreML libraries that are included.
* If I'm unable to find a pretrained hand-detection model, then use Microsoft Custom Vision or IBM watson to create a new one.
* Realm for the back-end.
* Swift testing libraries for testing.
